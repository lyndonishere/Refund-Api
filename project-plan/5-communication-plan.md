# Communication

We will need to be in close communication with each team member in order for us to succeed with this project.

Our main forms of communication are:

## Standups
Each morning we have a standup where we will check-in with each other, discuss blockers, discuss plans for the day, and do a coding challenge to warm up.

Here, we can let others know if there is something we are struggling with and can decide what approach to take.

## Breakout Rooms
Each work period we will be split into Breakout Room #2, where we will again check-in with each other and discuss our plans for the afternoon.

This is our primary work period together.

## Discord
We can use Discord to both communicate more live info and communicate after-hours if needed.

On Discord, there are 5 current text channels

- General: discuss any general topics
- Github: any questions or discussion about using the Github repo
- Project-Info: any updates to the project requirements
- Current-Tasks: what we are currently working on
- To-do Tasks: what we want to work on today

## Traceability Matrix
This is where our formal updates will go-- it's a Google sheet that will help us see:
- Who is working on what
- What features need to be worked on
- Test statuses
- Feature status (will remain incomplete until nearing the end of our project probs)
- Notes section if anyone encounters any major bugs or blockers
